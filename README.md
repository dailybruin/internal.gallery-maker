# start.django-react

A single Docker container hosting both React and Django. 

The React App is accessible directly at `localhost:8000`.
The Django API is accessible at `localhost:8000/django/`.

The `/django_static/` and `/media/` subpaths also serve static files.

## How to use

1. Place the .env file in the root folder, and add the following:
```
	DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
	SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
	DEBUG=True
```

2. Run this in the react directory to generate the production build:

```
	npm install
	npm run build 
```
NGINX container only serves React App's production build.

3. (Optional) Modify `utils/urls.py` and `utils/views.py` in the Django project to handle adding meta tags. Instructions have been added in those files.

4. Return to root directory and build container:

```
	docker-compose build
	docker-compose up
```

## Generate production

1. Modify ONLY the request URLs from React; change them from `localhost:8000/django/a/b/c` to `your-server.com/django/a/b/c`.
2. Modify .env files accordingly.
3. Remove the code to start development server in entrypoint.sh and also change nginx.default to serve production instead of development.

### Rancher deployment

1. Add container to load balancer with port 80.
2. Add volumes for log and media folders.

## Important details

### Modifications to Django

In settings.py, we have to add the following to allow NGINX to serve the files correctly.
```
	FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = '/django'
	STATIC_URL = '/django_static/'
	STATIC_ROOT = os.path.abspath('/var/www/django_static') 

	MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
	MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.abspath('/var/www/media/')
```
These are explained in comments in settings.py.

### Things to handle

1. React Router should be able to handle subpaths correctly e.g. given a subpath /a/b/c/d it routes to the correct page
2. React App must not have any subpaths that conflict with NGINX instructions i.e. /django, /django_static or /media.

### For consideration

1. Should `npm run build` be included in entrypoint script?
2. Testing
